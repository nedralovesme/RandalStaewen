# RandalStaewen
A game dev portfolio site made with node.js, Handlebars, Bootstrap, and jQuery

This project was the first personal project I made and it really highlights how little I knew about which packages i'd need. I think I have every node package known to man in 2017 in there. Definite cringe now, but the client was happy.

In retrospect, this absolutely did not need to be anything more than a very very basic bootstrap site. I thought the client would want to do more with it, but he just used it to get hired and didn't touch it again.

I still like the style choices I made here and the minimalism that I opted for. I started to exercise I bit more restraint around this time.
