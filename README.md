# RandalStaewen
A game dev portfolio site made with node.js, Handlebars, Bootstrap, and jQuery

This project was the first paid project I ever did. I opted to do it with node.JS and Handlebars mostly just because I wanted more practice with node and the client was really cool.

In retrospect, this absolutely did not need to be anything more than a very very basic bootstrap site. But again, the client was a very chill guy and let me do it how I wanted to do it. Thanks buddy! :)

I still like the style choices I made here and the minimalism that I opted for. I started to exercise I bit more restraint around this time. Still, if I were to do this site today, I would just do it as a simple HTML/CSS Bootstrap site.
